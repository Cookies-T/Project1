        <p>The school I attend is Cerritos College. The school was founded in 1955, and I have been
        attending for a few years now. The school itself has a nice atmosphere and is constantly
        finding ways to improve. There are many options to choose from, so finding the right class
        should not be an issue. Cerritos also makes sure that they have their education options be as 
        affordable as possible, so anyone can be a student here.</p>
