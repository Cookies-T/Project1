		<p>Hello, my name is Joseph Torrez, and using HTML is all new to me. I have been
		going to Cerritos College for a while now, and I am currently going for a computer
		science major. I have taken other coding classes, and am also taking a cybersecurity
		class. I look forward to learning a lot in this class, and interested to do more coding.
		I also enjoy doing math, so I am also taking math classes, and am currently taking Calculus.</p>
