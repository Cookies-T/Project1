    <p>Hello, I am Joseph Torrez, and I am currently a student at Cerritos who is trying to major in computer programming. I have little experience in HTML, and I hope to learn much more and be able to do projects with ease. I have also taken other computer programming classes, so I also have some knowledge with programming in other languages, such as Java, C++, and Python. One class I can say I enjoy the most that is not directly related to computer programming would be math. After I finish with computer programming, I also plan on majoring in cybersecurity.</p>
